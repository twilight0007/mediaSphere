MediaSphere is a full-stack streaming platform developed using the MERN

Technical Stack:

Frontend (React + Redux Toolkit):
React: Handles the user interface, making the application dynamic and responsive.

Redux Toolkit: Manages application state effectively, especially user data like login status, movie preferences, and streaming history. The Toolkit simplifies state management.
Backend (Node.js + Express):

Node.js: Provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture that supports high concurrency, ideal for real-time applications like streaming services.

Express: Serves as the server framework, enabling the creation of RESTful APIs for efficient communication between the frontend and backend.

Database (MongoDB):

MongoDB: A NoSQL database that allows flexible schema design, which is helpful for storing diverse data like user information, preferences, and movie details. MongoDBâ€™s document structure is well-suited to storing JSON-like data, making it compatible with the data structures in a MERN stack application.
